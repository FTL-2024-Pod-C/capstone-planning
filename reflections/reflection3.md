## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing this week was being able to implement and perfect our request and delete functionalities, which are some of our core features for our website.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

A challenge we faced this week was making our website presentable for our users. Firstly, it was hard to make our website responsive as most of the CSS code we previously wrote was made for a laptop and not a mobile device. Adjusting the code to work for both devices was quite difficult and took a lot of adjusting, testing, and debugging. Secondly, we faced a lot of styling challenges in trying to make our website look better for our users, as we struggled to find our website more visually appealing.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

No, we did not finish all of our tasks for our sprint plan this week. Although we finished all of our core features, we did not necessarily finish our CSS styling and responsive design. There are still some things we would like to work on for our website in terms of making it look more visually appealing for our users. We did not finish our remaining tasks as we had to pivot from original plans multiple times, which caused us to change our planning and scheduling. We only need to work on CSS styling and responsive design, so we will make it our highest priority for this weekend.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The mentors were a really helpful resource in helping us execute the code for our different functionalities in the Capstone Project. The documentation on useState variables (shared Devarsh) was particularly helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Our stretch features, which include the Google Maps API and review feature are "at risk" as we have just decided not to implement them at all due to time constraints. To accomodate these changes, we decided to change our plan by completely dropping those features and focusing our attention on making our website look better, as well as debugging.
