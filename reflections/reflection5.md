## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 

The pacing of this project was good. There was a lot of time to work on the overall project and complete the MVP. We just had to cut a few features due to time constraints.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

There were a few features that we identified as stretch goals from the beginning. Therefore, when we decided not to include those features, it didnâ€™t significantly alter our plans. Given what we know now, we would have better planned our individual tasks and clearly assigned responsibility for each feature.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

The labs and weekly assignments were helpful in learning the materials necessary for completing the project. However, if we made more time I would have like to explore OpenAI and other AI APIs in greater depth.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

The most valuable resources were the instructors. They were consistently willing to assist and delve deeply into how the code functions. Additionally, they offered insightful advice on how to effectively achieve our goals and present our work.
