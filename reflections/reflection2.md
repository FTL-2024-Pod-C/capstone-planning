## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing we did this week was complete our addListing function, which allows restaurants to dynamically add listings and allows food pantries to see the listings posted by the restaurants from their dashboard.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One challenge our group faced this week was how we experienced a major blocker when creating our addListing function, as we tried to pass a component into a link. We figured out that we could not do this and had to instead use state variables to solve this problem. This was a challenge as we could not figure this out on our own and required the help of our mentors and outside resources to solve this. With this being our first functionality we worked on in our platform, it was also a challenge adjusting to all the merge conflicts and GitHub issues that arose with our project for the first time.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did not finish all of the tasks for our sprint plan, as we still had the search/sort functionality left to implement. We also needed to finish implementing the cart functionality, as it does not fully work as expected yet. The reason why we did not finish our anticipated features is because we did not calculate for the possibility of blockers. We also did not plan properly when accounting for how much time each feature should take, which set us back when we actually had to set tasks to do for each day during the sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The mentors were a really helpful resource in helping us execute the code for our different functionalities in the Capstone Project. The articles on useState variables (shared by Erika and Devarsh) were particularly helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Our rating/review page as well as our Google Maps API integration are two features “at risk” as they were initially apart of the core features of our website, until we realized we would not have enough time to work on them, leading to them becoming stretch features. We have adjusted to this risk by allowing these features to fully become stretch features for us, making us able to mainly focus on the very core functionalities of our website (adding a listing, seeing donation history, etc.).
