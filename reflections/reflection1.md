## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing we did this week was set up the frontend with the most important features required for our application to work. We have the landing, login, sign up, and dashboard pages ready to be intergrated with the backend next week.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We had a lot of merge conflicts in Github that took up a significant amount of time this week. It was difficult to figure out because we are not super familiar with git commands and how to solve the specific issues we were facing. Now that they are resolved we hope that we will be able to get more done in our project with a good understanding of how to reolve merge conflicts.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We feel that we underplanned for this week because we left the implementation of all of our important functionailities such as search, sort, request for next week. We need to also prioritized getting the frontend integrated with the backend.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes the videos provided by the instructors, specifically the User Authentication Tutorial, were beneficial for us.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The feature "at risk" is the rating feature. It is last on our list so we may not get a chance to set that up. We would simply not implement it if we run out of time because our application would still work and be beneficial without it.
