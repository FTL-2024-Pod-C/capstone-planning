# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Julia, Karina, Madel**

## Problem Statement

In the United States, restaurants generate 22 to 33 billion pounds of food waste annually contributing significantly to economic challenges. Concurrently, approximately one in eight households face food insecurity or lack access to nutritious meals.

## Description

The main purpose of this website is to ensure that restaurants ethically dispose of their waste to food pantries in need of nutritious donations. Restaurants can upload their leftover food and food pantries can view such listings and make requests based on their needs.

## Expected Features List

* User Authentication/Profiles
    * Restaurant Log In
    * Food Pantry Log in
    * Food pantries and Restaurants can view each otherâ€™s profiles for details
* Dashboard
    * Restaurants will upload their listings based on quantity, type, allergen/dietary restrictions, etc.
    * Food Pantries can view this dashboard and make requests accordingly
* Request System Functionality 
    * When on the dashboard of listings pantries can make requests
    * Restaurants can view and accept requests
* Searching/Filtering
    * Food pantries can search for specific foods they need as well as filter restaurants by location
    * Drop down menu
* Donation history
    * Restaurants can keep track of their donations and inventory status
* Rating System
    * Food pantries can rate restaurants in order to build trustful relationships
* Automated Matching/Recommendation System
    * Food pantries can get matched with/get recommended restaurants automatically based on their needs, preferences, and location

## Related Work

Food Runners: This is a website for an organization that helps donate excess food in San Francisco. While this website shares a similar concept to our idea, our project distinguishes itself by acting as an intermediary that directly connects food pantries with restaurants. Our website also looks to serve the national community extending beyond the San Francisco area.

Food Cloud: Connects supermarkets with charities and communities in need of food across the UK and Ireland. While this website has similar functionality to our project idea, ours stands out as food pantries can request food directly from the source compared to Food Cloud where food pantries have to go through Food Cloud themselves.

## Open Questions

* Questions Regarding This Project
    * What are the legal requirements and regulations for food donation in different states or regions?
    * Are there any liability concerns for restaurants donating food, and how will these be addressed?
    * How will the system handle a large number of users and data entries?


* Topics to Research More for the Project
    * Research the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act and other relevant laws to ensure compliance.
    * Look into data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and best practices for securing user data.
    * Explore efficient methods for managing the logistics of food donation
    * Research effective strategies for community outreach and engagement to attract and retain users on the platform.
    * Study algorithms and technologies for building effective matching and recommendation systems.
